# Credit Defaulter Analysis and Prediction

This project uses exploratory data analysis to identify patterns that can be used to detect potential
credit defaulters. The data is used to identify the driving factors behind loan default and to assess the risk
associated with lending to customers. The goal is to ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan
are not rejected, while also minimizing the risk of loss for the company.

## Requirements

Before you get started, you will need to make sure you have the following requirements:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- The folder uploaded in UB box, which contains all the necessary contents

## Running the code

To run the code, first you will need to change the PATH variable in the file `database_main.py`, line 14, to the location of the folder uploaded in UB box. 

Once that is done, you can run the notebook `EDA.ipynb` and the code should execute correctly.
